About PadletVision: Every child in the world will grow up with Mickey Mouse and Padlet. Product: We are making the default way of collecting and sharing thoughts on the Internet. People love the product. Impact: We have over 50 million active users making Padlet one of the most used apps on the planet. Our goal is to be THE the most used app on the planet. Money: We are venture backed AND profitable. We are built to last one hundred years. Badassery: We are 36 people (plus a baby crane that we've adopted but it doesn't really do much).

Sorrows of engineering at PadletWe grew pretty fast last year and our processes are still catching up. E.g. we don't have 100% code coverage yet. Our deployment process isn't as painless as it could be. This sometimes leads to spending time on things that aren't the most fun. We’re working on it!Our project management process could be better. This sometimes leads to re-speccing in the middle of development, getting in the way of programming flow. We’re working on it!Some people you‘d be working withLinh Nguyen: At any given point, no one really knows where Linh is. We learn of his existence through pull requests and code reviews.
